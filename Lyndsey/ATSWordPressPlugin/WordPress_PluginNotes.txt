Notes for planning ATS WordPress plugin:

- Use custom post type?
 use javascript / php to validate fields on post save
- Somehow loop through fields in custom post and save them all together as an array of KVPs
- Loop through fields of custom post type to display table headers for view page
- use javascript to filter view page
