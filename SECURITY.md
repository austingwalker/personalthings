# Exposed API Key

Hi Joe, I'm an API support engineer at Dropbox Sign. I'm writing you via this file as I could not find any other contact information for you on your github profile. 

We noticed that you exposed your API key in this file that you committed https://github.com/fortunecookie1138/personalthings/blob/e8c6323fbd52d58c23b7be520830d8f1981dd8d1/Lyndsey/HelloSignSignatures/getSignatures.py

We highly recommend that you generate a new API key as exposing your API key is a security risk.

Best,
Austin
API Support Engineer at Dropbox
